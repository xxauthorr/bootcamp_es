# bootcamp_es
Hi Mates, This is my first restful api project done using Go Language. It took me over three weeks to complete the project and i have included multiple api's and packages in it.
The whole project is done on popular golang framework called Gin. The project is dedicated to the esports community. It is basically a platform for gamers and their associates.
Through this application anyone can able to host and book their tournaments and practice matches for any type of e-games. This can be done after creating an account in this application. It is basically an alternative of discord but in bootcamp esports it is much more easy to make it happen because here i only included the things that are really needed for the gamers. It is very secured that i have used the JWT authorization and OTP signup.
